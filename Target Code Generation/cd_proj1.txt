load, store
	mem access - variable, address
add, sub, mul, div
	reg, reg
	reg, imm
	imm, imm
branch - cond, uncond
	bgt, blt, bge, ble
	
identify load/store, add/sub, branch
after that identify subbrach, according to that make the assembly code

can use symbol table for addresses of the variables used

make a dictionary to map registers and variables called mappings

if there is a var in rhs and is not in mappings, then call the gen_ld_stmt function

make a st statement for all mappings at the end
